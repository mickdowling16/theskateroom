# The Skate Room

The Skate Room is an online store and community for the skaters of Ireland. The skate store sells skateboards, skate apparel and accessories and provides information to users on local events and skate park get togethers. The Skate Room is more than an online store, it is a community run by skaters for skaters.

## Strategy

I stTarted my project by outlining my startegy and thinking about my target audience and the features they would need.

The target audience for The Skare Room is 

- People aged 18 - 35
- Skateboarders
- People interested in skateboarding 
- People interested in skateboard culture and fashion

Users will be looking for

- A place to buy and upgrade their current skating setup
- A place to purchase skating apparel from well known brands
- Information about meet ups, competitions and new skate parks
- Keep up to date with special offers, new events and social gatherings

My website will try to offer users these features in a clean and intuitive way. The design hopes to appeal to the target audience with a cool skate vibe and be a website which is shared around the skate community. My aim is to become a one stop shop for news, competition info, skating apparel and accessories and custom board design. My website will have to be fully responsive to be available on the go on all device sizes. I will use Bootstrap grids and elements & custom CSS to achieve this.

# Design

The design for this project is based off of skatepark culture and brands such as Converse, Vans and DC. The design I'm going for is black and white with thick black font and heavy lines used throughout. The font im using for heading is Russo One and the font for the body is Kanit. I got these fonts from Google fonts. I use accents of yellow throughout the website to add a bit of colour where needed but mainly my site is going to be black and white.

# Features

My online store contains plenty of features to benefit my users and make my site user friendly. The landing page contains the main navigation and user menus along with a call to action to visit the store. Further down on the homepage is where the upcoming events are displayed. This is important to be on the homepage as my website isn't primarily a online store it is a community for skater to get news and updates on events along with being able to update their skating setu  in the store.
